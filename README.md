# Full-Stack Application with Angular Frontend, .NET Backend, and MySQL Database

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application that integrates an Angular frontend with a .NET backend and a MySQL database. It is designed to provide a robust and scalable architecture for modern web applications, enabling efficient data management, secure backend services, and an interactive user interface.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
**Angular**: Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It provides a powerful way to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces with a component-based architecture.

### Backend
**.NET (ASP.NET Core)**: ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It provides a robust backend for handling API requests, authentication, and business logic.

### Database
**MySQL**: MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system. It is known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance. In this project, MySQL is used to manage and store application data.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main directories:

- **frontend/**: Contains the Angular project files.
- **backend/**: Contains the .NET project files.
- **database/**: Contains SQL scripts for database schema and seed data.

### Frontend Structure (`frontend/`)
- **Angular Components**: Modular and reusable UI components.
- **Services**: Handle data fetching and business logic for the frontend.
- **Routing**: Configures client-side routing for navigation.
- **Styles**: CSS stylesheets for UI design.

### Backend Structure (`backend/`)
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
- **Models**: Define the data structures and entities.
- **Services**: Implement the business logic and interact with the database.
- **Configuration**: Settings for database connections, CORS, and middleware.

### Database Structure (`database/`)
- Files inside **/database**: SQL script for creating database tables.
- Files inside **/database/Data**: SQL script for populating the database with initial data.
